Ninlil

Since my purpose for this program is to emphasize the fleeting nature 
of our postings on Tumblr by deleting them -- those older ones 
whose context is long gone -- I have named it for a Sumerian goddess 
of the air.

Tumblr.fs -- contains Ninlil.Tumblr, with Post and API types 
             to simplify calls to the Tumblr API for a given account

Ninlil.fs -- contains Ninlil.Main, with a program which finds 
             all posts older than a certain date and deletes them :D

Feel free to build upon these.  Tell me if you make anything exciting!
