This tool to delete older Tumblr posts -- those whose context is
long gone -- is named for a Sumerian goddess of the air.  All things
are fleeting.

Tumblr.fs -- contains Ninlil.Tumblr, with Post and API types 
             to simplify calls to the Tumblr API for a given account

Ninlil.fs -- contains Ninlil.Main, with a program which finds 
             all posts older than a certain date and deletes them :D

Feel free to build upon these.  Tell me if you make anything exciting!
